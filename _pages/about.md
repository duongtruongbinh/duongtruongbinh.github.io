Hello! I'm Truong-Binh Duong, a final-year Computer Science student at the VNU-HCM, University of Science, specializing in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.

I have a strong passion for leveraging data and AI to solve real-world problems. Through my advanced integrated Bachelor's-Master's program, I have built a solid foundation in machine learning theory, deep learning architectures, and the end-to-end data science lifecycle.

I thrive on turning theory into practice. My project work has allowed me to dive deep into areas like computer vision, natural language processing, and predictive modeling. I have hands-on experience developing complete solutionsâ€”from data scraping and model training with frameworks like PyTorch, to deploying them with tools like FastAPI and Google Cloud's Vertex AI.

I am actively seeking full-time opportunities where I can contribute my skills to a challenging and data-driven environment, and continue to grow as a Data Scientist or AI Engineer.

Feel free to connect with me through the social channels below!
